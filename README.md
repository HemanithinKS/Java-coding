# Java-coding

## Overview

The `Java-coding` project is a collection of various Java programs aimed at demonstrating essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques using Java. This repository showcases multiple use cases of Java programming, ranging from basic syntax and control structures to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, data structures, and multithreading.

## Key Features

1. **Bank Account Management**  
   - **File**: `BankAccount.java`  
   - **Description**: Implements basic banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals. It showcases the use of classes, methods, and OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance.

2. **Duplicate Number Detection**  
   - **File**: `FindDuplicateNumbers.java`  
   - **Description**: Uses arrays and HashSet to find duplicate numbers in a list. This program emphasizes efficient data handling and the application of algorithms to optimize performance.

3. **Multithreading with Multiplication Tables**  
   - **File**: `MultiplicationTableThread.java`  
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the use of multithreading to generate multiplication tables. This program helps understand thread creation, synchronization, and managing multiple tasks concurrently.

4. **Factorial Calculation**  
   - **File**: `factorial.java`  
   - **Description**: A simple program to calculate the factorial of a given number using iterative and recursive approaches.

5. **Palindrome Check**  
   - **File**: `palindrome.java`  
   - **Description**: Checks if a given string or number is a palindrome, illustrating string manipulation techniques and conditional logic.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HemanithinKS/Java-coding.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Java-coding
    ```

3. **Compile the Java Files**: Use the Java compiler to compile any of the Java files. For example:
    ```bash
    javac BankAccount.java
    javac FindDuplicateNumbers.java
    javac MultiplicationTableThread.java
    ```

4. **Run the Programs**: Execute the compiled Java classes using the Java runtime environment. For example:
    ```bash
    java BankAccount
    java FindDuplicateNumbers
    java MultiplicationTableThread
    ```

## Usage

- **Learning and Practice**: This repository is perfect for students and developers who want to learn Java programming and practice coding through various examples.
- **Concept Demonstration**: Each program demonstrates specific Java concepts, making it a useful reference for understanding Java syntax, OOP principles, data structures, and multithreading.
